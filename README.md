# mini-c
C Headers/Sources I made about a year ago (at the time of writing this doc).

* `args.h` - command-line argument parser, I don't remember how it works so docs will appear later.
* `help.h` - helper functions (readline and an implementation of `strcpy` for some reason)
* `map.h` - config file reader (see `test.txt` for an example)
* `name.c` - testing file for everything. (use as API reference for now)
